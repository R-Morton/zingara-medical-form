# Zingara Medical Form

## Description

A project for a client who is expanding her massage business and has requirements related to medical forms.

The current focus is on the interactive medical form itself, but currently also works to save clients locally for now. 
Basic features currently allow the user to view clients and see their medical form results and write notes. This in future will be greatly expanded.
